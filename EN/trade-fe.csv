campaign,faq,FAQ,
campaign,grid2401_faq_1,1. How are rewards calculated?,
campaign,grid2401_faq_1_res,"<>
        The total prize pool is 21,000 USDC, with 3,000 USDC distributed every
        24 hours, for a total of 7 distributions.
        <br /> <br />
        Following the start of event, the system will settle accounts every 24
        hours and distribute the daily prize pool to eligible grid strategies
        according to their weight. The weight calculation is derived from the
        value of the grid strategy and the duration in minutes of the grid
        created that day.
        <br /> <br />
        The value of the grid strategy is determined by the initial value when
        the grid is set up and does not change with price fluctuations. Each
        user has a participating fund limit of $5000 for the grid strategy
        boost. Users can establish multiple eligible grid strategies from the
        same address during the activity, but the total eligible funds is capped
        at $5000.
        <br /> <br />
        For example: There are only two users participating in the grid strategy
        event. At the 24-hour settlement mark, User A has set up a grid strategy
        worth $2,500 lasting 500 minutes, and User B has set up a grid strategy
        worth $6,000 lasting 1,000 minutes. If 3,000 USDC is distributed that
        day, then the weight ratio of A to B is: (2,500 x 500) / (5,000 x 1,000)
        = 1:4, meaning A receives 600 USDC, and B receives 2,400 USDC.

        strategy to create a strategy more suited to your own preferences and
